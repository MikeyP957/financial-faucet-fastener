# financial-faucet-fastener
An application to help you manage your finances.

## Overview
    Financial Faucet Fastener is an app that allows a user to input data so that they can track their expenses over an extended period of time. The app is functional both connected or disconnected from the internet. When the user finds connection again their data is uploaded to the remote database where their information is stored.

## Deployment
    The code for this app is currently functioning with out any errors. The webpack is deployed once the program starts running and allows the user to continue using the app when disconnected from the internet. At the moment there is a problem deploying the app to Heroku.

## Technologies

Data Storage: Mongo Db for storing data while the user is online and an Indexed DB for when the user is offline.

NPM packages were used for routing, building the webpack and communicating with the database.

# Next Steps
This project is still needs to be deployed and have more options for displaying data.
